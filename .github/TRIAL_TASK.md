# Trial Period

Thank you for your interest in a position at Holdex. We are constantly looking for new talent to join our team and support our [portfolio companies](https://holdex.io/portfolio). As part of our process, we hire candidates who have successfully completed our Trial and have matched our expectations during it.

## Begin Trial
To start your trial task, please follow these steps:
1. Align yourself with our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Select your skill set:
   1. Designers: talk to us and we will provide you with access to our Figma
   1. Developers: 
      1. Python: https://github.com/truflation/truflation
      1. Solidity: talk to us and we will provide you with access to the repository
      1. HTML/CSS, JavaScript: https://github.com/holdex/holdex-venture-studio
      1. NodeJs: https://github.com/holdex/holdex-venture-studio
2. Fork repository and identify the problem to work on. Not all of these repositories will have problems listed. This means that you will need to create a GitHub issue (problem) yourself.
3. Provide a solution by creating PR and requesting a review for merge.

## Trial Completion
Usually, the trial period takes about 7 days, which can be extended if the case requires. Problems that are not solved and kept stale for a long period of time are automatically canceled.
To end the trial period, create a new GitHub issue in https://github.com/holdex/holdex-venture-studio repository with the following name: "`Your Name` Performance Review". Further, attach all the Problems you have solved during the trial period and the time it took you to solve them (in man hours). Finally, ping one of our core team members (Vadim, George, Mark) and we will take it from there. Looking forward!
