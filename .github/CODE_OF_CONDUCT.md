# Code of Conduct

1. Constantly align yourself with our core [Holdex values](https://holdex.io/about).
2. Ensure the quality of your work. Unless you are a beginner, it is a sign of poor ownership and lack of confidence when you expect someone else to review your incomplete work.
3. Assign yourself to the Problem you are solving so others are aware of it.
4. Donâ€™t use `@mention` when it is not crucial for the person to be notified. Use "reactions" (likes) instead.
5. Leave updates regularly to keep things transparent.
