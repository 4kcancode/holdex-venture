# Holdex Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [holdex.io](https://holdex.io) or related websites. Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting started

There are 3 core contribution pillars:
1. **Goal** – a business aim
2. **Problem** – an issue that is on the way to help us achieve the goal
3. **Solution** –  the actual deliverable which resolves the problem

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow: from finding a goal to work on, identifying the obstacles (problems) to achieve it, and the process of delivering your solutions.

### Goal

As soon as you get involved in one of our projects, you must understand the goal you are assigned to:
1. investigate the conversations and documents
2. make your own assessments, and figure out how things are already moving towards achieving the goal 

It is crucial to understand the business context of the goal and how achieving the goal will impact the project.

All goals can be identified as GitHub issues in the relevant repository. Goals are created and managed by Partner level contributors.

### Problem
Once the goal is clear, you must identify what stops you from achieving it. Anything that is stopping us - is a “Problem”. A typical question to ask is: "what valuable action the user can’t perform?".

We find and report these problems through [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues).  
Sometimes, a Goal already has a few problems reported, but it’s not always the case.  
We’re counting on our contributors to find these problems.

### Solution
The third final pillar of successful contribution is the "solution".

Different problems may require different set of skills.  
Whether it’s code, design, or marketing material, we expect a lean and clean solution from the contributor.

If the source-code modification is required, the solution is presented as [GitHub PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). 

#### PR requirement
We usually reject PRs which don't correspond to the following criteria:

1. **Small size**. [Keep PRs small](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2021/03/09/strategies-for-small-focused-pull-requests/) and completable within 3-4 hours. If the solution requires more time, then decompose the problem into smaller problems until you can solve that problem within 3-4 hours.
2. **Clear naming**. When creating PRs and commits, make sure the name of the PR is [clean and simple](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/#how-to-write-good-pr-titles). You must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines.
3. **Stalled PR**. We usually reject and close PRs which do not have ativity for the last 24 hours. Unless there is a clear comment in thas PR explaining a reason why that PR is stalled.
